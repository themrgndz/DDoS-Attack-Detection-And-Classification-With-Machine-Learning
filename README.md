## Detection and Classification of DDoS Attacks: Machine Learning Methods

With the increasing accessibility of computer technologies, cybersecurity challenges and complexities have become major concerns, especially for organizations operating in the field of information technology. Despite the development of numerous intrusion detection systems, computer systems remain highly vulnerable to various Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These sophisticated cyberattacks lead to system failures and service disruptions, resulting in billions of dollars in financial losses and irreversible reputational damage in recent years.

In this study, the detection and classification of DDoS attacks are targeted using machine learning algorithms. The selected dataset is optimized, and classifier models such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network (MLPClassifier) are developed. Evaluation is conducted using metrics like ROC curves, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy. Furthermore, the Random Forest modelâ€™s feature importance ranking is generated, and ROC curves are consolidated, with metric values visualized in a bar chart for different algorithms.
