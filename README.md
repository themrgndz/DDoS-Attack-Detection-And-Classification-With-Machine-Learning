## Detection and Classification of DDoS Attacks: Machine Learning Methods

The challenges and cyber complexities confront the organizations significantly, especially those operating in the information technology field with more access to computer technologies. Despite designing several intrusion detection systems, computer systems are still highly vulnerable to different Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. In this regard, sophisticated cyber-attacks have resulted in system failures and service disruptions, thus causing billions of dollars in financial losses while triggering irreversible reputational damage over the recent years.

This research focuses on the detection and classification of DDoS attacks using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is optimized, and some developed classifier models include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network-Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier. Classifiers should be evaluated based on ROC curves, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy metrics. It also generates the feature importance ranking arising from the Random Forest model and summarizes ROC curvesâ€”showing metric values in a bar chart across different algorithms.
